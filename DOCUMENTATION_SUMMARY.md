## 🎯 How to Use These Documents

### For Interview Preparation:

1. **Start with INTERVIEW_PREP.md**:
   - Read through each section thoroughly
   - Understand the concepts, not just memorize
   - Practice explaining code examples out loud
   - Review the interview questions and practice answering

2. **Use QUICK_REFERENCE.md for**:
   - Last-minute review before interviews
   - Quick command lookup during live coding
   - Reference when discussing specific features
   - Rapid concept recall

3. **Practice Talking Points**:
   - "I built a full-stack task management system..."
   - "The backend uses Laravel with a clean MVC + Handler pattern..."
   - "For authentication, I implemented token-based auth with Laravel Sanctum..."
   - "The frontend leverages Next.js 15's App Router with Server Components..."

### For Live Coding/Technical Discussions:

- Keep QUICK_REFERENCE.md open for command lookup
- Reference the API endpoints section when discussing architecture
